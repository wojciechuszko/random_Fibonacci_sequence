The code calculates a random Fibonacci sequence up to a chosen integer n, 
and plots its absolute value as well as its "growth rate", 
which typically stays close to the Viswanath's constant.
The two plots correspond to Figure 1 in https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2000-69-231/S0025-5718-99-01145-X/
